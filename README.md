# Next.js 15 Blank Page Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug encountered in Next.js 15 where a seemingly correct application fails to render, resulting in a blank page without any console errors.  This issue is particularly difficult to debug due to the lack of helpful error messages.

## Bug Description
A Next.js 15 application using a standard `pages/index.js` file is failing to render any content. The browser shows a blank page, and the developer console shows no errors or warnings.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the Next.js application is correctly configured and that no unexpected errors occur during the rendering process. Careful review of the application structure and dependencies is crucial.
